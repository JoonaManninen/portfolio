                <p> Hello and welcome to my about page where I will tell you some things about me. I'm studying in second year at LUT university to become software engineer someday. I have alwaus been interested in computers and that's really why I chose to study more about the topic and learn how to make software myself.
                    Also I have always been very good at logical thinking and problem solving so computer engineering suited my skillset well.
                </p>

                <h3>Mobile Development</h3>
                <p>In my short journey in software engineering I have found mobile development most interesting versus front-end or back-end. We have used mostly Android Studio to make mobile applications and used language has been Java which I have grown to like more and more after using it. You can find couple of my Android Studio projects from the project page.</p>

                <h3>front-end</h3>
                <p>I'm fairly new to front-end developing but the versitility in front-end has been intriguing and the fact that you can see what you have done with your own eyes is rewarding. My front-end skills at this point are CSS/SASS, HTML. JavaScript and ReactJs</p>
            </div>
            <div class="job job-3">
                <h3>Back-end</h3>
                <p>Back-end has been part of many courses in my studies so I know how to use Python, Java and C when making back-end for software.</p>
